**👋 Hi, I’m Edgar Sánchez**

Industrial Control & Automation Engineer focused on **Industrial IoT, data analytics, and energy-intensive systems**.

I work at the intersection of **hardware, data, and engineering decision-making**, helping industrial teams understand what is really happening in their processes — and how to improve it.

My background combines:
- Field engineering & instrumentation
- Industrial automation & control
- Data analysis with Python
- Technical–commercial project execution

---

**🔧 What I work on**

I focus on industrial systems that are:
- Critical to operations
- Highly energy-intensive
- Often under-measured or poorly understood

Typical systems include:
- Compressed air systems  
- HVAC & environmental control  
- Water & wastewater treatment  
- Industrial utilities and energy systems  

---

**🧠 Current focus**

I’m currently developing **engineering-grade analytics pipelines** for industrial systems, starting with compressed air.

The goal is not dashboards or buzzwords, but **trustworthy data and actionable insights**.

Core topics:
- Energy consumption behavior
- Pressure stability and operational risk
- Condensation and air quality risks
- Foundations for anomaly detection and AI-based diagnostics

**👉 Main project:**
**Air Compressed Analytics**  
(Industrial Python analytics pipeline for compressed air systems)

**🧱 How I approach engineering problems**

I don’t start with AI models or visualizations.

I start with:
1. Understanding the physical process  
2. Defining the right variables and sensors  
3. Ensuring data quality and traceability  
4. Applying analytics engineers can trust  

If the data cannot support a real operational decision, it’s not useful.

**📚 Technical writing & knowledge sharing**

I also write long-form technical essays based on **real industrial experience**, covering:

- Infrastructure and large-scale systems  
- Measurement and instrumentation  
- Living industrial processes  
- Automation, energy, and data
